\begin{lemma}
Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be an arbitrary set. Then there exists an infinite set $A$ such that all its infinite subsets are not Turing reducible to $C$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Define $A=\{p_1^{\chi_{C'}+1}\times...\times p_n^{\chi_{C'}+1} \in \mathbb{N} : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ where $p_1$, ..., $p_n$ are the first $n$ prime numbers.
If there was a set $B \subseteq A$ then we could enumerate an element $p_1^{\chi_{C'}+1}\times...\times p_n^{\chi_{C'}+1}$ for an arbitrarily large $n$ from which we could decide $C'$ for the first $n$ entries, as $n$ arbitrary hence for all entries, but $C'$ not reducible to $C$ where $'$ denotes a Turing jump.
\end{proof}
